Contains a tex file (with sample pdf) for writing exams containing a multiple-choice section and a short-answer section. Should be fairly straightforward to edit. 

Run randomise_exam.py to create multiple versions of the exam, with the multiple-choice questions and answers shuffled. Also produces answer keys. You can protect an answer from being moved out of position using the \fixedans command in the tex file.
